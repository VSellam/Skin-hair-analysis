# Skin-hair-analysis
This dataset contains structured records on dermatological and trichological health across 2,000 anonymized individuals from the Indian population. It supports AI/ML research in personalized care, dermatology, and lifestyle-linked skin health. Data is divided across diagnostic results, lifestyle factors, and AI-generated care recommendations.

Skin & Scalp Health Dataset (Indian Population)
Introduction: The Problem We‚Äôre Addressing Skin and scalp health issues are among the most common yet overlooked conditions affecting individuals across India. These conditions are deeply influenced by personal lifestyle, environmental factors such as pollution and humidity, and regional variations in skin tone and hair type. Despite this complexity, most existing diagnostic and care models rely on generalized approaches that fail to account for this diversity.
There is a growing demand for personalized, data-driven dermatological care that is context-aware and capable of adapting to the individual needs of patients. To meet this need, healthcare providers and AI developers require access to reliable, structured data that reflects the lived realities of the target population.

This dataset has been developed to support:
‚Ä¢	AI model development for image-based skin and hair diagnostics
‚Ä¢	Clinical and academic research on dermatological patterns across diverse Indian demographics
‚Ä¢	Education and training in applying machine learning to personalized healthcare
It captures a comprehensive view of each individual, combining diagnostic outcomes, lifestyle factors, and care recommendations. By focusing on an Indian population, the dataset enables context-specific insights that can inform more accurate and equitable health solutions.
